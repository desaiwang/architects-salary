# architects-salary

Visualizing architects' salary

# data-analysis

All information related to data queries, preprocessing, and initial analysis (for my personal understanding) was done inside [archinet_query.ipynb](./data-analysis-notebook.ipynb) using python.

This jupyter notebook is roughly broken into three sections:

1. Data Query
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Initial Analysis

TODO: talk about dependencies (maybe need to run ipynb in a fresh environment and download as needed?)

# site architecture

This site is built with html, css, and javascript. All the visualizations are done using the [d3 library](https://d3js.org/). A lot of my code is derived from Prof. Jeff Rzezsotarski's course notes on data visualization (INFO3300 and INFO4310) as well as projects I did while taking those classes.

# acknowledgements

This site would not have been possible without the help of Camille Lee, my lovely beta testers (Helen, Sophie, Allen, Garnet, and many others), and Prof. Rzezsotarski.
